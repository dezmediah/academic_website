Atlantan. Digital ecological humanist. Writer [creative writing] and [peer-reviewed publications]. Musician [bandcamp here]. Teacher [class syllabi here]. Friendly nerd.

My dissertation is about the cultural life of urban rivers, melding digital NLP methodologies, field work, and literary and film analysis. I look at the New York Estuary, the Los Angeles River, and the Elbe River and their tributaries.

I'm on bluesky at dezmiller.bsky
